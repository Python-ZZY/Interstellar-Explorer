In this game, you will fight as an astronaut against aliens on various planets. The game has 5 levels and is not very difficult.

## Controls
Use the \<A\> and \<D\> key to move left and right, and long press the \<W\> key to fly.

## Tips
Due to the game's design, if the player comes out of the left side of the screen, he will go back to the right. So you can take advantage of it to avoid the enemies' bullets.

At the end of each level, there is a "choose ability" interface. It is recommended to choose "Get stronger" and "Energy Boost" first.
